The Avalon Music Server is a Python WSGI application and several CLI scripts
that, together, scan metadata from a music collection, store it in a database,
and expose it as a JSON web service. It is available under the MIT license.

The Avalon Music Server is able to read metadata from ogg, flac, and mp3 files.
