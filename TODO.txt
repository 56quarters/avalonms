# TODO : Make sense of requirements, setup.py, unit tests, travis config, dev setup
# Should we generate a runtests.py file with py.test?
# Should travis have its own config that just installs tox? tox delegates to requirements-test?
# Should tests be run from `python setup.py test`?
# tox -> `python setup.py test` -> py.test via runtests.py?
