Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you have the pip Installer available.

It is available here: ``http://www.pip-installer.org``

Or by running something like the following:

Gentoo:

  :: 

    emerge pip

Ubuntu/Debian

  ::

    apt-get install python-pip


Installation via pip and PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  ::

    pip install avalonms


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've never been able to get TagPy to install using pip/PyPi. If you run into
issues with it, try installing TagPy using your system package manager.
